# Cortex 

Thanks for downloading the first beta version of Cortex! If you need a primer, make sure to use the Welcome page's "Getting Started with Cortex" walkthrough (`Help > Welcome`).

This version should have Chat, Quick Edit, Templates, Paper Search and Cite This. More features will be on the way if you keep using it!

## Support

If you have any questions or ideas, feel free to email me at spruce@mit.edu. 

There are some compromises in this version - notably there is the OpenAI API key requirement for the Chat and CMD+K model. If you really need an OpenAI key, ask me for one and you might get lucky.

Right now, the goal of Cortex is just to be a good editor for me to work on my assignments and research in. I'll keep updating it every now and then throughout the year with new improvements and I'm open to feedback. I think it would be really awesome if this could do for the research workflow what Cursor did for software engineering.
